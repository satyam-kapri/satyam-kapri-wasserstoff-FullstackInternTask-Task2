**This is task No. 2 , that is Visualisation Dashboard**

I have made this project using following dependencies:
1. React.js
2. Tailwind CSS
3. Material UI
4. Apex Charts
5. Google Geo Charts
6. Express.js
7. MongoDB
8. Node.js
   
Frontend is hosted on Vercel and Backend on Render.com

**Approach to the problem and Solution Strategy:**

I chose the second task, which was to create a visualization dashboard, specifically because of its complexity. My approach to solving the task began with understanding the data in more depth using Python's Pandas library. This analysis provided valuable insights that helped me determine the types of charts that would be most effective for representing the data.

After understanding the data, I moved on to designing the application's layout in Figma. Once the design was finalized, I researched various chart libraries for React. I decided to use ApexCharts because of its clean and visually appealing UI, as well as its easy documentation. Given that the data included fields like country and region, I also thought it would be a great idea to incorporate geographical charts. For this, I utilized Google Geo Charts.

In the coding phase, I initially created the charts using dummy data, without connecting to the backend server. Once the frontend was completed, I set up a new database in MongoDB Atlas. I then developed an Express server and created an API to send data from the MongoDB database to the React app.
